#For Loop: repeats a sequential algorithm on sequential data
#for iterating_variable in sequence:

#msg = "enter 3 numbers"
#mynums = []

#for i in [0,0,0]:
#    var =int(input(":"))
#    mynums.append(var)
#    print(mynums)
    #block statement - always ends in a colon and is indented
    #must use a specific amount of spaces aka 4 (indentation) for the above 3 lines
    #tells python when what you want repeated is finished
#print ("all done")


#2 ways of using a for loop

#mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]
#for i in mylist:
#    print(i+i)


# range()
#'range(5)'=[0,1,2,3,4]
#range generates list values dynamically
#'range[0]*100' generates a list of 100 0s and stores in in memory
#'range(100)' generates a list of 100 and stores in in memory
#start is inclusive, stop is non-inclusive
