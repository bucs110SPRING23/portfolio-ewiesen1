# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION 
My program used turtle to draw a t-shirt.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS 
No known bugs.

## REFERENCES 
Only used references from class.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS 
I tried my best to make my code as dry as possible. Ideally, I would have included the entire drawing of my t-shirt (listed below) in a for loop. However, I had a lot of trouble encapsulating all parts of the drawing in a for loop because of the multiple distances and angles being used. So, I put as much of it as I could figure out in the for loop and the rest is left out. Middle section was put into a for loop.
