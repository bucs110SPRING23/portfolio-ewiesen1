# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION 
This program is designed to give random phrases of advice to the user from the Advice Slip JSON API. It assumes the user is not feeling good. Then, it asks the user if the advice provided helped them feel better. If the user responds with "no", the program then generates a random Trump quote, most of which are ridiculous and hopefully can make the user chuckle, from the Tronald Dump API.
