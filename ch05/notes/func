function examples
    print()
    input()

functions encapsulate data that we don't want to keep in our heads

code = input("Input a code")
money = int(input("Give me money"))

def my_vending_machine():


Single Responsibility Principle
- a function should do one thing

A function should never be responsible for an input

Arguments
- can accress variables in global scope

collision
- two vairable of the same name
- can't have 2 variables of the same name in the same scope

def foo(): --- foo is a generic name for a function


When you pass data through an argument, you are only passing the data, not the variable

shadowing - using the same name as a global variable is called shadowing
